# Domain Transfer Steps - For Man or Beast

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Site deployed to Netlify:** https://timely-kringle-738610.netlify.app/  
‚è≥ **Waiting for:** Authorization code from Squarespace (within 24 hours)

---

## Step 1: Choose Your New Domain Registrar

**Recommended options:**
- **Namecheap** (recommended - good pricing, easy interface)
- **GoDaddy** 
- **Google Domains** (now Google Cloud Domains)
- **Cloudflare Registrar** (if you have Cloudflare account)

---

## Step 2: Initiate Domain Transfer

### Once you receive the authorization code email:

1. **Create an account** at your chosen registrar (if you don't have one)
2. **Look for "Transfer Domain"** or "Domain Transfer" option
3. **Enter your domain:** `formanorbeast.com`
4. **Enter the authorization code** (from the Squarespace email)
5. **Complete checkout** (~$10-15, includes 1-year renewal)
6. **Confirm transfer via email** when prompted (important!)

---

## Step 3: Wait for Transfer Completion (5-7 days)

### What happens during transfer:
- Squarespace has 5 days to approve/deny the transfer
- Usually auto-approves after 5 days if no action taken
- You'll receive email updates on transfer status
- **Don't cancel Squarespace hosting until transfer is 100% complete**

---

## Step 4: Update DNS (After Transfer Completes)

### In your new registrar's control panel:

1. **Delete all existing DNS records**
2. **Add these DNS records:**

```
Record Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: Auto or 3600

Record Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: timely-kringle-738610.netlify.app
TTL: Auto or 3600
```

### In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to **Domain settings** ‚Üí **Custom domains**
2. **Add custom domain:** `formanorbeast.com`
3. Netlify will automatically enable SSL certificate

---

## Step 5: Test & Go Live (24-48 hours after DNS update)

### Final verification:
- DNS propagation takes 24-48 hours
- Test your site at: **https://formanorbeast.com**
- Should show your new portfolio!
- SSL certificate should be active (üîí lock icon)

---

## Important Reminders

### During Transfer:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep Squarespace active** until domain fully transfers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Your email may be affected** - plan accordingly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't make DNS changes** until transfer completes
- ‚úÖ **Netlify site stays live** throughout the process

### After Transfer:
- üéâ **formanorbeast.com** will point to your new portfolio
- üîí **SSL certificate** will be automatically enabled
- üìß **Set up email hosting** if needed (Google Workspace, etc.)
- üè† **Update business cards/links** to new hosting
